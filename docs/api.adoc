= GraphQL Library API
:toc: right

This document describes the constants and functions accessible through the library's API.

== Scalar types

A GraphQL object type has a name and fields, but at some point those fields have to resolve to some concrete data.
That's where the scalar types come in: they represent the leaves of the query.

GraphQL comes with a set of default scalar types:

* GraphQLInt
* GraphQLFloat
* GraphQLString
* GraphQLBoolean
* GraphQLID

Since version 1.2.0 of GraphQL Lib also supported the following scalars:

* Json
* Date
* Time
* DateTime

== Type wrappers

By default the type of field has an occurrence of 0..1.
To make the field mandatory or a list, use the functions ``nonNull`` or ``list``

=== nonNull

Returns a modified type that indicates the underlying wrapped type will not be null

==== Arguments
|===
|type: GraphQLType | Wrapped GraphQL type
|===

=== list

Returns a modified type that indicates a list of the underlying wrapped type

==== Arguments
|===
|type: GraphQLType | Wrapped GraphQL type
|===

=== reference

Returns a special type that allows an object/interface type to reference a type by its key. Necessary for self reference.

==== Arguments
|===
|typeName: String | The type name
|===



== Schema execution function

==== Arguments
|===
|schema: Schema (Required) | GraphQL schema created
|query: String (Required) | GraphQL query to execute
|variables: JS Object (Required) | JS Object containing the variables used in the query
|context: JS Object (Optional) | The context object to use for GraphQL call. Data of this object available for each field
|===
