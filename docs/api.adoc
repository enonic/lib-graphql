= GraphQL Library API

This document describes the constants and functions accessible through the library's API.

== Scalar types

A GraphQL object type has a name and fields, but at some point those fields have to resolve to some concrete data.
That's where the scalar types come in: they represent the leaves of the query.

GraphQL comes with a set of default scalar types:

* GraphQLInt
* GraphQLFloat
* GraphQLString
* GraphQLBoolean
* GraphQLID
