= GraphQL Library API
:toc: right

This document describes the constants and functions accessible through the library's API.

== Scalar types

A GraphQL object type has a name and fields, but at some point those fields have to resolve to some concrete data.
That's where the scalar types come in: they represent the leaves of the query.

GraphQL comes with a set of default scalar types:

* GraphQLInt
* GraphQLFloat
* GraphQLString
* GraphQLBoolean
* GraphQLID

The following scalars are supported starting from version 1.2.0 of the GraphQL Lib:

* Json
* Date
* Time
* DateTime

The following scalars are supported starting from version 2.0.0 of the GraphQL Lib:

* LocalDateTime
* LocalTime

== Type wrappers

By default the type of field has an occurrence of 0..1.
To make the field mandatory or a list, use the functions ``nonNull`` or ``list``

=== nonNull

Returns a modified type that indicates the underlying wrapped type will not be null

==== Arguments
|===
|type: GraphQLType | Wrapped GraphQL type
|===

=== list

Returns a modified type that indicates a list of the underlying wrapped type

==== Arguments
|===
|type: GraphQLType | Wrapped GraphQL type
|===

=== reference

Returns a special type that allows an object/interface type to reference a type by its key. Necessary for self reference.

==== Arguments
|===
|typeName: String | The type name
|===



== Schema execution function

=== execute

Executes a GraphQL query and variables against a schema

==== Arguments
|===
|schema: Schema (Required) | GraphQL schema created
|query: String (Required) | GraphQL query to execute
|variables: JS Object (Required) | JS Object containing the variables used in the query
|context: JS Object (Optional) | The context object to use for GraphQL call. Data of this object available for each field
|===

== Schema creation functions

Starting from version 2.0.0 of the GraphQL Lib in order to create a schema you must use `schemaGenerator` object, which contains the following functions:

=== createSchema

Creates a GraphQL schema

==== Parameters
|===
|query: GraphQLObjectType (Required) | Root query type
|mutation: GraphQLObjectType | Root mutation type
|subscription: GraphQLObjectType | Root subscription type
|dictionary: Array<GraphQLObjectType> | Additional types (Necessary for types accessed through references)
|===

=== createObjectType

Creates a GraphQL object type

==== Parameters
|===
|name: String (Required) | Type name
|fields: JS Object (Required) | JS Object containing the type fields
|interfaces: Array<GraphQLInterfaceType OR GraphQLTypeReference> | Type interfaces
|description: String | Type description
|===

=== createInputObjectType

Creates a GraphQL input object type

==== Parameters
|===
|name: String (Required) | Type name
|fields: JS Object (Required) | JS Object containing the type fields
|description: String | Type description
|===

=== createInterfaceType

Creates a GraphQL interface type

==== Parameters
|===
|name: String (Required) | Type name
|fields: JS Object (Required) | JS Object containing the type fields
|typeResolver: Function (Required) | Type resolution function
|description: String | Type description
|===

=== createUnionType

Creates a GraphQL union type

==== Parameters
|===
|name: String (Required) | Type name
|types: Array<GraphQLObjectType OR GraphQLTypeReference> (Required) | Possible types
|typeResolver: Function (Required) | Type resolution function
|===

=== createEnumType

Creates a GraphQL enum type

==== Parameters
|===
|name: String (Required) | Type name
|values: Array<String> (Required) | Possible values
|description: String | Description
|===

In order to create an instance of `schemaGenerator` call `newSchemaGenerator()` method of the GraphQL Lib, for instance:

```
const libGraphQL = require('/lib/graphql');

const schemaGenerator = libGraphQL.newSchemaGenerator();

schemaGenerator.createObjectType({
   ...
});
```

=== Breaking changes

==== 2.0.0
Functions can no longer be created directly, use the `schemaGenerator` object instead.
